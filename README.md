# ProjectGrapple

This project was initially completed during June of 2022 as part of a University Assignment involving the Unreal Engine.

> The project aims to be a First-Person Shooter that aims to appeal to the competitive market with a high emphasis on mobility and movement. This includes features such as a momentum system, wall running, double jumping, and a grapple hook. Similarly to games like Titanfall and Quake. A movement shooter.
> 
> The movement system should be accessible enough that anyone can experience the joy of being able to move fast while having features that can take your gameplay potential for the more competitive people for a high skill ceiling with a generous skill floor.

Although not quite as ambitious, this project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the Unreal Engine and my, at the time, skill as a programmer which I am pretty proud of.
